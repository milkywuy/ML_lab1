Lab 2

The question i chose was "How does study time affect student's GPA?"
finding a GPA requires a regression model as it a numeric value, i picked a a DB from Kaggle and used Google Colab to inspect the values
I printed the first 5 rows along with the number of rows, columns and the average GPA and study time
