# ML_lab1

hello!
my name is danah gharamah, i am a 3rd year cyber security student who adores the world of 1s and 0s something that really piqued my interest about ML is how it affects gaming. as a gamer who is into coding and want to create my own indie game some day, it seems like such a cool feat in a game when something you do affects your own personal experience instead of a game being a hard-code that just follows rules. i hope in this course my knowledge in ML grows further :)!
